# Guava Base JUnit Test Suite

This is a selection of tests taken from the official [Guava Tests](https://github.com/google/guava/tree/master/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/base) repository. It was used to compare the energy consumption of AssertJ with that of JUnit assertions. The converted repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sarajuhosova/guava-base-assertj).
